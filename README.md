Verify k-ordered FM-Index correctness with FMtree using kISS
===

Introduction
-----

This project aims to verify the correctness of k-ordered FM-Indexes constructed using the kISS (k-ordered Induced Suffix Sorting) algorithm. The verification process utilizes FMtree, a fast locating algorithm for FM-Indexes, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the k-ordered FM-Indexes in genomic data processing.

kISS is designed to efficiently construct k-ordered FM-Indexes, optimizing pattern matching tasks in genomics. By leveraging induced-sorting-based suffix array construction, kISS improves time and space complexities. FMtree complements this by providing robust verification and pattern locating capabilities.
